  dcterms:description "Mabel Pines (born August 31, 5 minutes before [Dipper Pines](Dipper)) is a 13-year-old girl (12 prior to the events of the finale) spending the summer with her [Great Uncle Stan](Grunkle_Stan) in Gravity Falls, Oregon, where she and her brother frequently encounter the supernatural. She is also the deuteragonist of the series. She takes a much less serious approach to life than her twin brother, as she navigates her way around odd, new surroundings. Mabel is represented by the Shooting Star in the Zodiac." ;
